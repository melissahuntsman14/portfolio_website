<h1> About me</h1>
<p> Hi, I am Melissa. </p>

<p> I am currently studying design at Massey University with a major in visual communcication design.
  I love to be creative when I get the chance, my favourite things to create and design are posters.
  I also love taking photos and videos in my spare time. </p>

<p> Summer is my favourite time of the year as that's when I usually am able to pull out my camera and go pro
  in order to get some footage.
  I love spending time with my friends, going on adventures and seeing my family.
  I prefer to be outdoors exploring new places or searching for views but I also like to be at home
  watching a good tv series with a bowl of ice cream. </p>

  <p> At home I have three crazy brothers, a dog called Charlie and my Mum and Dad we love to spend time
    together watching the rugby, going out kayaking, going on bush walks, eating and playing board games.
    Sometimes I get my home mixed up with the zoo as it can get wild at times, but that's all part of the fun. </p>

  <p> I want to travel the world and it has been a dream of mine since I was young.
    My dream destination would have to be Bora Bora or Hawaii or anywhere tropical!
    Another dream destination would have to be Europe, I think I would visit everywhere possible. </p>
